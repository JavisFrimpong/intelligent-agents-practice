# intelligent-agents-practice

* Overview

This repository contains practical labs demonstrating agent implementation using the SPADE framework in Python.

- Lab 1: Introduced basic SPADE agents and cyclic behaviours.
- Lab 2: Expanded the concept to agent perception, enabling a SensorAgent to detect and log simulated disaster events with timestamps, disaster types, and severity levels.

# Lab 1 – Basic SPADE Agent
- Objective: Learn SPADE agent creation and cyclic behaviour.
- Result: Agent executed cyclic tasks successfully, printing messages periodically.

# Lab 2 – SensorAgent Perception
- Objective: Implement perception for disaster monitoring.

- Procedure:
* Created DisasterEnvironment simulating disaster type and severity.
* Implemented SensorAgent with cyclic behaviour.
* Logged percepts with timestamp to event_log.txt and memory.

# Tools Used
- Python 3
- SPADE Framework
- GitHub Codespaces / Visual Studio Code
